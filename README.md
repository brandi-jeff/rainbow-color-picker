# Rainbow-Color-Picker
## About the Project
This code was started in class during my JavaScript course in my SDE cohort. It only uses JS for now and was used as one of the lessons to 
introduce us to JS. 
<br>
<br>
This program was designed to accept a rainbow color as input (roygbiv), return that color in its hexcode, and change the background of the page to that color. 
It can also return a random hexcode and background color with a certain input.<br>

-> *Sidenote: Our instructor helped us refactor the code a lot to make things simpler, so there will be a lot of comments in the code. 
Most of the comments are code that was originally there, but then taken out to simplify the code. Other comments are just notes of issues I had and then solved.*
<br>
## How it Works
1. A prompt will appear and ask the user to enter a color of the rainbow (roygbiv). 
2. If the user enters one of the rainbow colors, it will return that color's hexcode.
3. If the user chooses a color that is not in the rainbow, a message will let them know the color they input is not a color in the rainbow.

### BONUS- Change background color
For our first bonus:
1. A prompt will appear and ask the user to enter a color of the rainbow (roygbiv). 
2. If the user enters one of the rainbow colors, it will return that color's hexcode AND change the background to the color entered as the input.
3. If the user chooses a color that is not in the rainbow, a message will let them know the color they input is not a color in the rainbow, and change the background
to a default background. 

### BONUS BONUS- Return random hexcode color and change the background color
For the second bonus:
1. A prompt will appear and ask the user to enter a color of the rainbow (roygbiv). 
2. If the user enters "random", a random hexcode is generated and returned to the user, and then the background is changed to that random hexcode color.
3. If the user chooses a color that is not in the rainbow, a message will let them know the color they input is not a color in the rainbow, and change the background
to a default background. 

## THANK YOU!
I am still working on my READMEs so thanks for reading and hopefully this gave some quick insight to this code. A lot of the code was completed outside of class using some helpful tips
and guidance from our instructor and classmates. Debugging was my BFF when trying to make sure every function did its job and you can see some of my issues from some 
of the notes I left on the code. This was fun and I'm excited about everything I learned writing this code.

## Credits
I am thankful to my instructor Nelly Sugu and my classmates for their input and guidance on this project.
